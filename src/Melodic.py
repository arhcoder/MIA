            Tunes the melody based on a revised hierarchical LWRS algorithm that considers
            contextual importance of each note within a phrase and its harmonic context

            [LWRS Algorithm takes a list of elements and randomly selects one of them, giving
            higher probability to items at the top of the list]

            This function is intended for Harmfirst models, where harmony is generated first
            and melody adapts to it. The process takes tonal music principles of hierarchy
            and classifies the notes of the melody by importances:
                - Structural
                - Main
                - Important
                - Step

            Notes are classified based on their context within a phrase using 4 properties:
                - "long": note duration is >= 50% of the bar size
                - "strong": note begins exactly when a chord changes
                - "first_of_phrase": is the first note of a phrase
                - "last_of_phrase": is the last note of a phrase

            The classification hierarchy:
                1. Structural: if ("strong" and "long") or ("strong" and "first") or ("long" and "last")
                    - LWRS Selection list: [Chord notes], ordered with highest pitch first

                2. Main: if only "strong", or ("strong" and "last")
                    - LWRS Selection list: [Chord notes + Scale notes excluding duplicates]

                3. Important: if only "long" or only "first" or only "last"
                    - LWRS Selection list: [Chord notes + Scale notes excluding chord tones]

                4. Step: all others
                    - LWRS Selection list: [Chord notes + Scale notes excluding chord tones +
                      Rest of notes not in chromatic scale]
            
            Additionally, on the selection it order the elements on the list to favor the proximity to the
            objective notes, trying to give the direction according to a "shape" that could be:
                - "arch": up-down-up
                - "valley": down-up-down
                - "rise": up-up-up
                - "fall": down-down-down
                - "random": Choose one of the previous shapes randomly

            Parameters:
                - shapes [list[str]]: List of shape names for each phrase: With possible values:
                    "arch", "valley", "rise", "fall"
                    NOTE: The length of this list must be equal to the number of phrases in the melody
                - octave [int]: Initial octave for starting melody generation (default is 4)
                - max_jump [int]: Maximum allowed interval jump (default is 12 semitones)
                - verbose [bool]: If True, prints additional information during processing (default is False)

            Process:
                1. Uses "map_note2chords()" to map melody notes to their corresponding chords:
                    a. mapping_notes [list[int]]: Index list where each entry maps a melody note to a chord index,
                        [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] means the first note is upbeat (maps to last chord), next two to chord 0, etc
                    b. sound_chords [list[Chord]]: Chord objects for each segment with access to .notes (pitch and octave)

                2. Groups notes by phrases

                3. For each phrase:

                    4. For each note:
                        a. Calculates its context using properties: strong, long, first_of_phrase, last_of_phrase
                        b. Classifies it into one of four categories based on these features
                        c. Builds selection list using the rules above and sorts items based on pitch distance and direction

                        d. Applies optional pitch constraints:
                            - Adjusts target octave relative to prior note to keep within melodic shape
                            - Applies max jump limit
                        
                        e. Uses LWRS to select a note from the list
                        f. Appends selected (note, octave) tuple to final tune list

                5. After all phrases:
                    - Iterates over melody notes in the Melody object
                    - Assigns each selected (note, octave) to replace original values (skipping silences)

    def map_note2chords(self):
        """
            Maps each audible note in the melody to the chord that is sounding at its start time
            The mapping follows these rules:
            - If both melody and harmony have anacrusis (upbeat), the first chord in harmony 
                defines the upbeat. Every note that starts before the upbeat is complete is mapped
                to -1. If a note in the upbeat overflows its available space, it is still mapped as -1,
                and the extra (overflow) is carried over into the first sound chord
            - For the remaining notes, we maintain an accumulator (current_offset) for the current
                chordâ€™s available space. Each note is mapped according to the chord in which its start
                (the current_offset) falls. Even if a noteâ€™s full duration causes the accumulator to exceed
                the chordâ€™s capacity, it remains mapped to that chord, and the excess is carried over
                to the next chord
            - Silence notes (with note value "X") add to the cumulative space but are not mapped
            - In the harmony, any chord with name "X" (a rest) that follows a sound chord has its
                space merged externally into that chord
            
            From self.melody and self.harmony it uses:
            self.melody: an object with attributes:
                - anacrusis [bool]
                - upbeat [int]  [not used directly; the upbeat length is taken from self.harmony.chords[0]]
                - phrases: list of Phrase objects, each with:
                    - notes: list of Note objects having:
                        - note: a string ("A" for sound, "X" for silence)
                        - space: a numeric duration
            self.harmony: an object with attributes:
                - anacrusis [bool]
                - chords: list of Chord objects, each with:
                        - name: a string ("E" or "X" for silence)
                        - space: numeric duration
                        (Any silence chord (name "X") following a sound chord is merged externally)
            
            Returns:
            [tuple]: (mapping, sound_chords) where:
                - mapping is a list of integers. Each element corresponds to an audible note 
                (notes with note != "X") in melody:
                    - If -1 means the note starts in the upbeat
                    - If 0, 1, 2, â€¦, are the successive sound chords
                - sound_chords is a list of the Chord objects (from harmony) that are not rests,
                with their effective total durations stored externally
