            Having the melody and the harmony, tunes the melody using the LWRS algorithm
            [LWRS Algorithm take a list of elements and decide randomly one of them, but
            giving more probability to be selected according to the order on the list, in
            which the further up the list you are, the more likely you are to be selected]

            This is a method for Harmfirst models, because the Harmony is made first and the
            melody depends on it, so it uses the Tonal music principle of hierarchy
            For select the frequency of a note based on the chord, the steps are:

            1. Preprocessing:
                - Retrieves a mapping between each audible note and its corresponding chord index 
                    using "map_note2chords()", along with a list of "sound chords" from the harmony
                - Obtains the diatonic scale for the current key via "notes_of_scale"
                - Defines a chromatic scale (12 semitones) to be used for proximity and stepwise motion

            2. Helper Functions:
                - get_directed_chromatic(last_note, direction):
                    Builds a directed chromatic sequence from a starting note in a given direction 
                    ("up" or "down"), ensuring candidate notes remain within an octave (plus one extra note)
                - order_scale(scale):
                    Orders the diatonic scale tones by a predefined functional importance
                - common_tones(chord1, chord2):
                    Determines the common note names between two chords for smoother voice-leading

            3. Segmentation of the Melody:
                - Groups the melody's audible notes into segments based on the chord mapping
                - Each segment is characterized by its chord index, the start and end indices in the mapping,
                    and the "density" (number of notes played over that chord)
                - Notes that start a new segment are flagged as chord-boundary notes, important for transition

            4. Notes Loop: For each audible note in each phrase:
            
                a. Determine Context:
                    - Identify the current chord from the mapping. For an anacrusis note (mapping value -1), 
                        the last chord is used
                    - Identify if the note is a chord-boundary note (the first note in a segment)
                    - Retrieve previous and next chord objects if available to support voice-leading across chords
                    - Retrieve the last assigned note (if any) for proximity considerations

                b. Build the candidates List:
                    The candidates list is built in four groups, then concatenated and passed to the 
                    weighted random selection function (lwrs):

                    - Group A: Current Chord Tones:
                        * Consists of all tones from the current chord, ordered by proximity relative to 
                        the last note (if available) using a directed chromatic scale
                        * For the first note of phrase, an ordering of highest first is used

                    - Group B: Adjacent Chord Context:
                        * Includes common tones between the previous chord and the current chord, if available
                        * For chord-boundary notes, also includes common tones between the current and next chord,
                        inserted at the beginning of this group to ensure smooth transitions

                    - Group C: Diatonic Scale Tones:
                        * Contains scale tones from the current key, ordered by functional importance and excluding
                        any candidates already present in Groups A and B

                    - Group D: Chromatic Fillers:
                        * Supplements with additional candidates from a directed chromatic scale
                        * These fillers are filtered by a maximum allowed leap, which is set more restrictively, so
                        when the chord density is high (favoring stepwise motion) and more liberally when density is low

                c. Direction Decision:
                    - A decision on whether the melodic motion should continue upward or downward is made,
                        potentially using an enhanced version of ewrs to favor continuity or voice-leading cues

                d. Final Selection:
                    - The fully assembled candidate list is passed to lwrs, which selects one note based on a logarithmic
                        weighting favoring candidates at the top of the list
                    - The selected candidate (a (note, octave) tuple) is then assigned to the current note

            5. Updating the Melody:
            - Once all phrases and their audible notes have been processed, the melody object is updated with the newly
                assigned note names and octaves, replacing the original pitches

            Returns:
             - [Melody]: The updated melody object with tunned notes acoording to the harmony

            - If both melody and harmony have anacrusis (upbeat), the first chord in harmony 
                defines the upbeat. Every note that starts before the upbeat is complete is mapped
                to -1. If a note in the upbeat overflows its available space, it is still mapped as -1,
                and the extra (overflow) is carried over into the first sound chord
            - For the remaining notes, we maintain an accumulator (current_offset) for the current
                chordâ€™s available space. Each note is mapped according to the chord in which its start
                (the current_offset) falls. Even if a noteâ€™s full duration causes the accumulator to exceed
                the chordâ€™s capacity, it remains mapped to that chord, and the excess is carried over
                to the next chord
            - Silence notes (with note value "X") add to the cumulative space but are not mapped
            - In the harmony, any chord with name "X" (a rest) that follows a sound chord has its
                space merged externally into that chord
            
            From self.melody and self.harmony it uses:
            self.melody: an object with attributes:
                - anacrusis [bool]
                - upbeat [int]  [not used directly; the upbeat length is taken from self.harmony.chords[0]]
                - phrases: list of Phrase objects, each with:
                    - notes: list of Note objects having:
                        - note: a string ("A" for sound, "X" for silence)
                        - space: a numeric duration
            self.harmony: an object with attributes:
                - anacrusis [bool]
                - chords: list of Chord objects, each with:
                        - name: a string ("E" or "X" for silence)
                        - space: numeric duration
                        (Any silence chord (name "X") following a sound chord is merged externally)
            
            Returns:
            [tuple]: (mapping, sound_chords) where:
                - mapping is a list of integers. Each element corresponds to an audible note 
                (notes with note != "X") in melody:
                    - If -1 means the note starts in the upbeat
                    - If 0, 1, 2, â€¦, are the successive sound chords
                - sound_chords is a list of the Chord objects (from harmony) that are not rests,
                with their effective total durations stored externally
