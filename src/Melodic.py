            Having the melody and the harmony, tunes the melody using the LWRS algorithm
            [LWRS Algorithm take a list of elements and decide randomly one of them, but
            giving more probability to be selected according to the order on the list, in
            which the further up the list you are, the more likely you are to be selected]

            This is a method for Harmfirst models, because the Harmony is made first and the
            melody depends on it, so it uses the Tonal music principle of hierarchy:
            For select the frequency of a note based on the chord, the preference of selection is:

                1. Notes of the chord
                2. Notes of the key scale
                3. The rest of the notes
            
            Parameters:
                - octave [int]: Value of octave for starting to select notes (4 by default)

            Process:
                1. It uses "map_note2chords()" method to map which note sounds in which chord, this method get
                two things:
                    - a. mapping notes [list [int]]: Each element is a sound note on the melody and its value represent
                        the number of the chord that the note belongs to, for example: [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]:}
                        This melody has 9 no-silence notes, when the note is "-1" it represent and upbeat note, so
                        use the last chord of "b. sound chords", then they are two notes of the first chord (0),
                        then two notes for second chord (1) and then 4 notes for the last chord (2)
                    - b. sound chords [list[Chord]]: List of soundable chords, where it can be possible to get from
                        each chord the variable "notes" that is a list of Notes and each note contains "note" (for
                        example "C" and "octave", for example 4)

                2. Separates which notes are for which phrase
                3. For each phrase it take the notes and the chords of it and do:
                    4. Selects randomly 50/50 if the phrase goes up or down
                    5. For each note un phrase:
                        6. If it is the first note of the phrase, it make a list using the notes of the chord
                           (taking as first the highest note) and then the notes of the scale, and select the
                           initial note of the phrase using LWRS
                        7. If not the first note of the phrase:
                            8. Make a LWRS list of [Selected direction, the other direction] and selects the
                            direction of the following note (is more probably to select the direction of the
                            initial direction decision on the phrase, but not the 100% of probability) [IN
                            TERMS OF LWRS, IT HAS THE 63% FOR USING THE SAME DIRECTION]
                            9. When the direction is already taken, it takes the notes of the chord and order
                               being first the most near note to the last note (based on the direction), then
                               add this notes to the main selection list
                            10. It takes the rest notes of the scale ignoring the notes that are already on
                                the chord and add to the list in order of how near they are to the last note
                                using also the direction (if the direction is up it takes all the up noted from
                                the last note, ordering by distance, else take the down notes
                            11. It uses the LWRS algorithm to select the note and replace with "last_note" to repeat
                                the process until finishing the notes of the phrase and start with the next phrase
                            12. Saves the note in a list "tunes" as tuple (note, octave), it has to be the same size
                                of the mapping notes list
                12. When finish with all the notes, then take the object Melody and iterate over each Note for Phrases
                    and for each note that is not silence (name="X") it changes the values of "name" and "octave" to give
                    the selected values for notes and then returns the object Melody with this modified values

            Maps each audible note in the melody to the chord that is sounding at its start time
            The mapping follows these rules:
            - If both melody and harmony have anacrusis (upbeat), the first chord in harmony 
                defines the upbeat. Every note that starts before the upbeat is complete is mapped
                to -1. If a note in the upbeat overflows its available space, it is still mapped as -1,
                and the extra (overflow) is carried over into the first sound chord
            - For the remaining notes, we maintain an accumulator (current_offset) for the current
                chordâ€™s available space. Each note is mapped according to the chord in which its start
                (the current_offset) falls. Even if a noteâ€™s full duration causes the accumulator to exceed
                the chordâ€™s capacity, it remains mapped to that chord, and the excess is carried over
                to the next chord
            - Silence notes (with note value "X") add to the cumulative space but are not mapped
            - In the harmony, any chord with name "X" (a rest) that follows a sound chord has its
